# David Beazley's Blog

Hi, I'm [Dave](https://dabeaz.com).  This is my blog about various programming related topics.   You may know me from the Python world as the author of the [Python Cookbook](https://dabeaz.com/cookbook.html), [Python Essential Reference](https://dabeaz.com/per.html), and newly released [Python Distilled](https://dabeaz.com/python-distilled/index.html).  You can learn a lot about Python from my tutorials, talks, and courses below:

* [Tutorials](https://dabeaz.com/tutorials.html)
* [Talks](https://dabeaz.com/talks.html)
* [Practical Python Course](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python)
* [Advanced Python Mastery](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/python-mastery)

If you want something more advanced, consider taking one of my [CS courses](https://www.dabeaz.com/courses.html).

After a multi-year hiatus from blogging, this is a bit of an experiment in hosting a blog solely in the form of a GitHub repo.  Posts are in reverse chronological order.

## Notifications

New posts are made via a "release".  You can be notified as follows:

* [Follow @dabeaz on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@dabeaz)

## Feedback

If you see a typo or want to make a comment on something, submit a pull request.  You might even be able to do it from GitHub itself (press '.' to bring up an editor while viewing the repository).
I have also activated discussions for the repo so that can also be a place for conversation.
